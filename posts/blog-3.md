So, I used Wordpress as the headless CMS in the previous version of my app. But I didn't want to pay $100 each year to fucking stupid Godaddy. Why? Because I am not even a blogger and I wrote almost nothing here. The only options I had:

- Fuck Godaddy
- Fuck Wordpress
- Use Markdown to write posts

It was kind of easy, but I had to do it quickly because I only had a few hours left before Godaddy fucked my credit card again. I am not at all sorry for using the word fuck again and again (I just hope nobody finds my blog, ever!)

## The Process

The process was fairly simple. I just had to follow the official NextJS tutorial. The only hurdle I faced was that my app was setup a bit differently than the turotial. Other than that, everything was pretty straight forward.

## Writing In Markdown

Writing in md isn't as hard as it looked. Everything is the same (kinda), and I don't have to pay for anything lol. Imagine paying fucking Godaddy free money. They're dicks. They lost my domain once and fuck them.

## Why Didn't I use Firebase, Supabase etc?

If you want to have sex, do you get fucked by a bull first? Or.... If you want to fight your wife, do you pull out an AK-47? If you said yes, then you're a sociopath who needs to suck his dick. Using a database would be overkill for this little project of mine.

## What Now?

Well, I just wanted to talk about the image. I fucking love it... I kind of promised, I'll never give fuck all about featured images so I just choose whatever I like... The image is called **Crossing the Teremakau River**, painted on 1876 in London, by Nicholas Chevalier. It was a gift of Mrs Caroline Chevalier, the artist's widow who also lived in England. Cool right?
