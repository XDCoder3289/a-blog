I didn’t know any Next JS before I started building this app. Here’s what I did:

- Revise JavaScript
- Go through the React Docs
- Go through the NextJS docs
- Found a way to use WordPress as my CMS
- Start building a blog application

Although this blog is fairly simple, it wasn’t that easy to build, considering that I haven’t used any JS framework ever!

## Revising JS

I went through the [basics of JS](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) in an hour or two, and I didn’t focus too much on the DOM. React handles DOM for you so, fuck it.

Here’s what I think someone should know before they dive into React or Next.

- Asynchronous Functions
- Arrow Functions
- Ternary Operators
- Array Unpacking
- Handling JSON Data

## Learning React JS

I believe this is the most important part of learning NextJS. Next.js is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications. So basically, Next is built on React.

Honestly, you [don’t need to know a lot of React](https://react.dev/) to learn Next. Understanding State, React Hooks and React Components is enough.

## Learning Next JS

This was the easier part. [Next](https://nextjs.org/) makes a lot of things a lot simpler. I loved the framework. I only had problem connecting Headless WordPress to my NextJS app.

Next JS makes it very easy to build an SPA out of anything, and I believe for someone who has a good understanding of JavaScript, Next will be a walk on the beach.

The only thing that troubled me was the fact that a lot of the tutorials were on Typescript. I hate strongly typed programming languages. They make me nauseous.

## Buying Namecheap and BlueHost Hosting

Namecheap was a nightmare. I’ll never ever use it again. I have gotten my refund, thank God!

BlueHost is shit too. They weren’t, but I don’t know what happened. I made an account, paid for a year’s worth of hosting, and my account got stuck in the creation process. I got a free domain which I can’t use. It’s still stuck btw.

## Choosing Godaddy

I just went with Godaddy because I wanted to host my WordPress dashboard for cheap somewhere. I just wanted to use the GraphQL plugin of WordPress that’s it. Godaddy works fine for that purpose. Nope! I didn’t buy a domain name. Fuck that!

## Deploying

I used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) because it’s fucking awesome. It’s also the company that created Next, so there wasn’t any competition there honestly. People who host Next on platforms other than Vercel are dumb fucks LOL.

The process was simple:

- Upload the project on a Git Repo
- Go to Vercel and add the project from Git
- Voila!

Changes are even simpler. If you want to develop some more features to the app and then push the changes to Vercel, you just have to push it on Github. Vercel picks the changes up, and then emails you about the app redeployment in seconds.

The best ever!

## What Now?

Nothing…. This will be my blog, and I’ll just diss people and companies here. I plan to keep it as my own personal journal. Yay! BTW, I’ll always use nature’s images as featured, because fuck it.
