So, I don't know what to do... I tried to make Fuk Math, but I don't think that's going to be a very good idea. Instead, I've decided
to make another SaaS product that helps people with SEO and enables them to manage their SEO clients.

I do think that's a good idea.

But why am I trying to do that?

## The AI Boom

I'm thinking that the internet boom from the 90's is similar to the AI boom of 2K23. That's the reason why I think I should just make apps that are related to AI and try to sell that. I'm not planning to make a lot of money, but I just want to set my foot through the door of AI.

## SEO Is Something That I Know

I know that this isn't "AI" per se, but companies like OpenAI are selling the shovels for the next boom. While I can't make the shovels, I can still try to dig out gold as much as I can. I just don't want to regret at a later age that I didn't give it a shot.

## What's My Tech Stack Going To Be

I will choose NextJS, Supabase and Vercel. I don't plan to make a very heavy app. Something that just enables me to acquire a few customers is going to be fine.

## When Do I Begin?

Fucking everything is against me atm. I have this project that I need to deliver to my client, and I need to make sure I build the first professional app before I can continue building my own product. SaaS products are a really good way to get experience with everything, and I think this is a good way to start into the SaaS world. I'll do my own SEO, acquire customers organically etc. I plan to invest as little as possible and make a company out of thin air LOL. I will be registering a business in the US though.
