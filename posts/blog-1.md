Remember when I said that I’ll build the app by the end of Sunday? Well, I just did. Time to remove this dummy text from the page, and write something for you.

## Here’s Who I Really Am

Honestly, I’ve been struggling to find the answer myself. I just think that the most important thing I know about me is that I love to build things.

I don’t like small talk, and I hate people who do so, but I love you… so you can do all the small talk you want.

I also feel like that I need to get more battering from the world, if that makes sense? I believe people who haven’t gone through anything are useless as fuck, but I might be wrong.

## Your FAQs

Here are some of your frequently asked questions:

<div class=>
- Do I think that you’re annoying? Well, yes.
- Do I love you? Loads!
- Do I care about you? Yes!!
- Can people change my views about your food? Hell Yea!

But babe don’t worry. I’ll still eat your food, no matter how over-cooked or under-cooked it is.

## What Do I Want To Do Next?

I’ll probably start making startups and selling them. Maybe stick with the one that I like working on the best. I just want to build stuff that helps people. There’s going to be nothing better than people using a product that I built for them. I’m just chasing the rush I guess.

## Pouring My Heart Out…

Remember when you told me that I’m the person who has problems? I know you were right. No! I am not over-thinking about it, I’m just stating that it’s true. But why do I think so?

Mish, I’ve been fighting all my life. I’ve struggled a lot, been hated, been loved, but the only thing that I learned is not to stick with the past. A past that might come back and haunt you. A past that eats your sleep away. Makes you shit yourself because it creeps the hell out of you.

Remember when you told me that I had depression? I think you were right, but there’s one teeny tiny detail you got wrong.

I’ve stopped giving a fuck about everything which means I am not depressed a.k.a sad actually. Depression is for fuck twads who can’t man up.

I truly love you, and I want to take care of you. I do act like an asshole sometimes, but I’m writing this for you to be happy in sad times. Whenever you feel “Sad” or “Depressed”, you can come back to this blog and read a bunch of nonsesnse that I wrote. Please make sure my kids turn out amazing. Don’t let them chicken out of problems. That’s what pussies do.

Teach them all the values and let them fly. Teach them to build a nest, and let them discover their own tree. Most importantly, tell them that I love them. I love them a lot! I know they’re not born yet, but I still love `em! Don’t know what else a father could do… Damn, feels weird to call myself a father.

Anywho, come back whenever you feel sad. Just make sure you never give up on the people you love. That’s what life is all about. You’re the richest person in the world if you feel like it so….

Oh, and I promise I’ll never believe in depression even if the world takes out my intestines and chokes me with it.
